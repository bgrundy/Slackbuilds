elasticsearch5 (Official low level python client for Elasticsearch)

Official low-level client for Elasticsearch. Its goal is to provide common 
ground for all Elasticsearch-related code in Python; because of this it tries 
to be opinion-free and very extendable.

It provides a more convenient and idiomatic way to write and manipulate 
queries. It stays close to the Elasticsearch JSON DSL, mirroring its 
terminology and structure while exposing the whole range of the DSL from Python either directly using defined classes or a queryset-like expressions.

It also provides an optional persistence layer for working with documents as 
Python objects in an ORM-like fashion: defining mappings, retrieving and saving documents, wrapping the document data in user-defined classes.
