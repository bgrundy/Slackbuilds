The pyxattr module is a Python extension module which gives access to
the extended attributes for filesystem objects available in some operating
systems.

The current supported Python versions are 3.4+ (tested up to 3.9).

The library has been written and tested on Linux, kernel v2.4 or later, with
XFS and ext2/ext3/ext3 file systems. If any other platform implements the same
behaviour, pyxattr could be used.
