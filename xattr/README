The xattr is a Python extension module which gives access to
the extended attributes for filesystem objects available in some 
operating systems.

The library has been written and tested on Linux, kernel v2.4 or later,
with XFS and ext2/ext3/ext3 file systems. If any other platform 
implements the same behaviour, pyxattr could be used.
